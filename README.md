# Enhance core ERP business processes with resilient applications on SAP BTP - SAP Private Link service

## Business Scenario

In this use case we are going to use the SAP Private Link service to communicate with an SAP S/4HANA system (or other SAP or non-SAP system running on a VM in your own Azure account) privately from within the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime without SAP Cloud Connector.

Using the SAP Private Link service will not require the SAP Cloud Connector anymore to expose the systems and communication through the internet, the entire traffic is secured by internal hyperscaler network without any exposure.

The current use case is describing an SAP S/4HANA extension application, of course having an SAP S/4HANA solution deployed on Azure infrastructure.
  
 >Note: Currently, we only support the connection from SAP BTP Cloud Foundry to Azure Private Link services. 

The business scenario in a nutshell:

John who is an employee of Business Partner Validation Firm iCredible, which is a third-party vendor of ACME Corporation would like to get notifications whenever  Business Partners are created/updated in the SAP S/4HANA backend system of ACME Corporation. John would then be able to review the Business Partner details in his extension app on the SAP Business Technology Platform. He would proceed to visit the Business Partnerâ€™s registered office and do some background verification. John would then proceed to update/validate the verification details into the extension app. Once the details are verified, the Business Partner gets activated in the SAP S/4HANA system of ACME Corporation. 

This means:

- You will deploy a custom extension application on SAP Business Technology Platform that works independently from the SAP S/4HANA system

- Changes in the SAP S/4HANA system are communicated via events in real time to the extension application

- The Vendor personnel only needs access to the extension application and not to SAP S/4HANA

### Solution Diagram

![solution diagram](./tutorials/05-PrivateLink/images/highlevel-arch.png)

The Business Partner Validation application is developed using the SAP Cloud Application programming Model (CAP) and runs on the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime. It leverages platform services like SAP Event Mesh, SAP HANA Cloud and the SAP Private Link service. Whenever a change in the SAP S/4HANA on-premise system occurs, an event on SAP Event Mesh is triggered. The CAP application on SAP BTP will asynchronously consume the event and process the payload. This means, some additional data is read using OData APIs from the SAP S/4HANA on-premise backend and stored in SAP HANA Cloud on SAP BTP to be independent from the actual SAP S/4HANA system.

## Requirements
The required systems and components are:

- SAP S/4HANA on premise system.
